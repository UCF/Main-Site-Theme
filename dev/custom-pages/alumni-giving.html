    <h2 class="h1 heading-slab-serif">IGNITE the Future of UCF</h2>
    <p>
Faculty and students make a university great. Research and education &mdash; in turn &mdash; help make our society a better place for everyone. But what is the spark that ignites it all?
</p>
<p>
For UCF, it started when 89 donors came forward with a $1 million donation to secure the land that is now home to one of our nation’s largest universities. Philanthropy is the spark that created UCF, and now we have embarked on an unprecedented campaign to raise $500 million.
</p>
<p>
UCF is challenging long-held assumptions about the role and scope of public higher education. We believe success can only happen when we expand opportunity and demand excellence. And with philanthropic support, we are poised to emerge as a new category of university, uniquely suited to meet the challenges and pursue the opportunities of our rapidly-changing world.
