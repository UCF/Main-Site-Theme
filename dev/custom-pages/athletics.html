          <p>
            Knights athletic teams have earned landmark victories on state and national stages&mdash;from American Athletic Conference titles to FBS bowl wins. But some of our student-athletes' most important triumphs have been in the classroom. They've achieved an average GPA of 3.0 or higher for 17 consecutive semesters and earned a 93 percent graduation success rate, which ranks number 1 in the nation for public universities. And a new director of athletics and head coaches in football and men's and women's basketball are continuing our winning traditions. Success isn't as sweet without the cheers of fans in the stands, so we'll give you access to free admission to every sporting event on campus. Being a part of the action is an important part of our lifestyle&mdash;because we're never as strong alone as we are together.

        <p>
          From the first kickoff in the driving rain on a converted cow pasture in 1979 to the inaugural football game before a packed house at the opening of our on-campus stadium in 2007 and our national headline-grabbing victory over Baylor in the 2014 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, UCF Knights have been building momentum for nearly four decades. And you've been cheering us on every step of the way. With your continued support, the best is yet to come.
