<h2>Outside Intrusion into UCF Network Involves Personal Data</h2>
<small><em>February 4, 2016</em></small>

Today I am sharing news that a recent outside intrusion into UCF’s computer network compromised the personally identifiable information of people in our university community.

UCF discovered the unauthorized access in January. University IT officials reported the incident to law enforcement and launched an internal investigation with the assistance of a national digital forensics firm. Initial reports indicate that this was an intrusion from the outside that targeted UCF data.

To date, our investigation has demonstrated unauthorized access to personal information for approximately 63,000 current and former UCF students and staff and faculty members, the majority of which are former students or employees.

We have launched this web page devoted to this incident that includes descriptions for the groups of current and former students and employees who are impacted, as well as recommendations for how you can best protect your identity moving forward.

We have established a call center that you can contact at 877-752-5527 between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. Monday through Friday if you have questions about this incident.

Those who are affected will soon receive a letter in the mail that explains how to sign up for one year of free credit monitoring and identity protection services.

<strong>Moving Forward</strong>

Safeguarding your personal information is of the utmost importance at UCF. To ensure our vigilance, I have called for a thorough review of our online systems, policies and training to determine what improvements we can make in light of this recent incident.

Every day, people and groups attempt to illegally access secure data from institutions around the world. Higher education institutions are popular targets.

UCF will continue to work diligently to protect this important information from those who would break the law to get it.

<h4>Who is impacted?</h4>
Based on our investigation, we believe the intrusion into the university’s computer network resulted in unauthorized access to certain personal information for two groups.

One group includes some current student-athletes, as well as some former student-athletes who last played for UCF in 2014-15. This group also includes some student staff members, such as managers, supporting UCF teams.

The second group includes current and former university employees in a category known as OPS, or Other Personal Services. Examples of positions in this category include undergraduate student employees (including those in work-study positions), graduate assistants, housing resident assistants, adjunct faculty instructors, student government leaders and faculty members who have been paid for dual compensation/overload (for example, teaching additional classes). If you are not sure of your employment category, you can check with your supervisor or your department’s human resources representative. Employees who previously held but do not currently hold OPS positions may be included.

We are notifying those impacted by the incident via letters that should be received the week of February 8.

<hr />

<h4>What specific information was involved?</h4>
For the group of student-athletes and student staff members supporting those teams, the information included first and last names, Social Security numbers, student ID numbers, sport, whether they were walk-ons or recruited, and number of credit hours taken and in progress.

For the group of employees, the information included first and last names, Social Security numbers and UCF-issued Employee Identification Numbers.

<hr />

<h4>Were my medical records, financial information or grades involved?</h4>
Based on our investigation to date, grades, credit card information, financial records and medical records are not involved.

<hr />

<h4>What have you done in response to this incident?</h4>
Upon learning of the incident, UCF immediately launched an internal investigation and reported the incident to law enforcement. We also engaged one of the nation’s leading incident response and digital forensics firms to assist in our internal investigation.

We are mailing notices to individuals who may have been affected by the incident so they can take steps to safeguard their personal information going forward.

We have already begun taking several actions to help prevent this type of incident from occurring in the future. These actions include enhancing user account and password security and expanding campus-wide information security education and training. We also are conducting a thorough review of our online systems and protocols.

<hr />

<h4>Did you report this incident to law enforcement?</h4>
Yes. Immediately upon learning of the incident, we reported it to law enforcement.

<hr />

<h4>How are you helping individuals who are impacted?</h4>
We regret any inconvenience or stress this incident may cause and are offering one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services to those impacted.

We have also established a call center for individuals with questions. The call center can be reached at 877-752-5527, Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-9 p.m. EST.

We will be scheduling forums where you can learn more about this incident, UCF’s response and how you can best protect your personal information in the cyber world. Details will be added to this website as soon as they are available.

<hr />

<h4>What should I do to help protect myself from identity theft?</h4>
Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend that you carefully check credit reports for accounts or inquiries you do not recognize. If you see anything you do not understand, call the credit agency immediately. If you find any suspicious activity on the credit reports, call your local police or sheriff’s office, and file a police report for identity theft and get a copy of it. You may need to give copies of the police report to creditors to clear up credit records.

We also recommend that you carefully review credit and debit card account statements as soon as possible in order to determine if there are any discrepancies or unusual activity listed. You should remain vigilant and continue to monitor statements for unusual activity going forward. If you see anything you do not understand or that looks odd, or if you suspect that any fraudulent transactions have taken place, you should call the bank that issued the credit or debit card immediately to let them know what happened.

We also recommend that you enroll in the <strong>free</strong> identity protection services outlined in your notice letter. Please note that you must complete your enrollment by the date included in your letter.

<hr />

<h4>How do I enroll in the identity protection services you are offering?</h4>
For more information about eligibility and instructions for enrolling for the complimentary identity protection services, please refer to the reference sheet included in the notice letter you received. Please note that you must complete your enrollment by the date included in your letter.

<hr />

<h4>How are you going to prevent this from happening again?</h4>
We have already begun taking several actions to help prevent this type of incident from occurring in the future. These actions include enhancing user account and password security and expanding campus-wide information security education and training. We are also conducting a thorough review of our online systems and protocols.

The online world is an integral part of our lives, but it also presents risks for incidents such as these. UCF will use this as an opportunity to educate our campus community about how to protect information and identities in a variety of online situations.

We will be scheduling forums where you can learn more about this incident, UCF’s response and how you can best protect your personal information in the cyber world. Details will be added to this website as soon as they are available.

Information about data security will be added to student orientations and some first-year courses. Information security became part of employee orientations in late 2015.
