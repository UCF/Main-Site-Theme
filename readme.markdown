# UCF.edu Theme - [The Main Website for the University of Central Florida in Orlando, FL](http://www.ucf.edu)

Theme built off of Generic Bootstrap to convert UCF.edu into a responsive WordPress site.


## Required Plugins
* Gravity Forms
* Varnish Dependency Purger

## Recommended Plugins
* WordPress SEO


## Installation Requirements

WordPress 4.2 is required (primarly for access to wp-a11y accessibility script).

* Make sure that all two- and three-column pages are correctly assigned sidebar menu widgets when content is imported. Menus, when imported, should maintain a common naming schema ('More Information - Page Name', 'Secondary Nav - Page Name', etc.)
* Add cron job for jobs/feedback-mailer.php to run weekly for feedback emails. The job should use wget to request the file, and the URL should have a 'secret' param with a value that is identical to the value set for the 'Weekly Feedback Email Key' Theme Options setting.
* Make sure that the 'Weekly Feedback Email Key' Theme Options setting is set and that Email Recipients have been specified.
* Make sure that the 'Enable Edge Side Includes (ESI)' Theme Options setting is set to 'On'.
* In Theme Options > News, 'News Max Items' should be set to '3'.
* In Theme Options > Search, 'Enable Google Search' should be set to 'Off'.
* Make sure that the 'Feed URL' and 'More Information URL' Theme Options are set.
* In Appearance > Widgets, remove any existing widgets from 'Left Sidebar' (or 'Right Sidebar', if there are any.)


## Deployment

This theme relies on Twitter's Bootstrap framework. UCF's fork of the Bootstrap project (http://github.com/UCF/bootstrap/) is added as submodule in static/bootstrap. Bootstrap must be initialized as a submodule with every new clone of this theme repository.

#### Initializing Bootstrap with a new clone:
1. Pull/Clone the theme repo
2. From the theme's root directory, run `git submodule update --init static/bootstrap`
3. From the static/bootstrap directory, run `git checkout main-site`. Make sure a branch has been checked out for submodules as they will default to 'no branch' when cloned.

#### Alternative method using Git v1.6.5+:
1. Run `git clone` using the `--recursive` parameter to clone the repo with all of its submodules; e.g. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/UCF/Main-Site-Theme.git`
2. From the static/bootstrap directory, run `git checkout main-site`. Make sure a branch has been checked out for submodules as they will default to 'no branch' when cloned.


## Development

This theme relies on Twitter's Bootstrap framework. UCF's fork of the Bootstrap project (http://github.com/UCF/bootstrap/) is added as submodule in static/bootstrap. To compile bootstrap:

1. If this is a brand new clone, run `git submodule update --init static/bootstrap`
2. If they are not already installed, install the dependencies in the Developers section of the Boostrap README
3. Checkout the latest tag of Bootstrap
4. Run `make bootstrap` from the static/bootstrap directory to compile the files into static/bootstrap/bootstrap.


## Notes

* The function _save_meta_data() in functions/base.php (line 1572) has been modified to properly handle Slider content.
* Slider "slide" meta fields are not duplicate meta boxes, but are actually dynamically-generated duplicate field groups, whose field values are saved into a serialized array for the given field.
* static/js/admin.js includes multiple required scripts for the Slider editor to save/load field values properly.
* This theme comes with pre-built SEO options, such as page title generation and OpenGraph settings.  However, if WordPress SEO is enabled, the built-in theme options will no longer be used (WordPress SEO should be used exclusively to handle these settings.)


This theme utilizes Twitter Bootstrap as its front-end framework.  Bootstrap
styles and javascript libraries can be utilized in theme templates and page/post
content.  For more information, visit http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

Note that this theme may not always be running the most up-to-date version of
